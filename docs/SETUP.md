# Project Setup

- **Engine**: Godot 4 LTS to ensure long-term stability for the MVP and reduce upgrade churn.
- **Rendering**: Forward+ renderer selected for balanced performance and modern lighting features suitable for large scenes.
- **Resolution**: Target 1920x1080 to match common displays and keep UI layout predictable.
- **Physics**: 60 ticks per second for responsive movement while keeping CPU cost manageable.
- **Anti-aliasing**: Disabled initially to conserve performance headroom during early development; revisit once budgets are validated.
